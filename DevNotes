Here are some notes for the Development of GWACI

Title: 
    Currently Pronounced as Gwah-key
    Needs better title, one more RPG like

Game Mechanics:
    -Being on a Chess board, I'm thinking Fantasy Middle Ages as the setting. 
    -Since all attacks go through the grid anyway, what if Towns took damage for every attack. Hero's would be critisized on doing too much damage to a town (especially if the enemy did less (which would start out higher if they were there first)).
    -Certain attacks that generate a lot more damage could be available right away. "Dudes super powerful, but risks destroying the town in attacking". Dexterity could help control the damage.
